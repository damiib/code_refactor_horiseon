# Code Refactor

This is a refactoring of code for the Horiseon website. Css and html are included. Images are in the assets folder.

HTML was cleaned up  using Semantic Elements and comments were added to aid in coding ease
CSS was cleaned up and commented to help with styling


![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
